- [ ] Can enable it

### Scenario 4: BLE Starts Working

**After granting permissions:**

**Expected Logs:**
```
[BLE-PERMISSION] ‚úÖ ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION: GRANTED
[BLE-PERMISSION] ‚úÖ BLUETOOTH_SCAN: GRANTED
[BLE-PERMISSION] ‚úÖ BLUETOOTH_CONNECT: GRANTED
[REAL-BLE] ‚úÖ All critical permissions granted
[REAL-BLE] üéâ Full BLE permissions granted!
[REAL-BLE] Starting BLE scan...
```

**What to Test:**
- [ ] No more error logs

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Alert Doesn't Show

**Check:**
1. Look for log: `[APP] üö® Showing BLE permission alert`
2. If missing, check: `showPermissionAlert listeners: X`
   - Should be `1` (not `0`)
3. If `0`, the event listener isn't registered

**Fix:**
- Verify `app/_layout.tsx` has the `useEffect` hook
- Try force-closing and reopening app

### Issue: Settings Doesn't Open

**Check:**
1. Look for Android error in logs
2. `Linking.openSettings()` might not work on all devices

**Workaround:**
- Manually navigate: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí offline-mesh-mvp ‚Üí Permissions

### Issue: Permissions Still Denied After Granting

**Check:**
1. Make sure you set Location to "Allow **all the time**" (not "While using")
2. Make sure "Nearby devices" is enabled
3. Check if Location services are ON globally:
   - Settings ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Use location: ON

**Fix:**
- Restart the app
- Check logs for permission status

### Issue: App Crashes on Startup

**Check:**
1. Look for error in Metro bundler terminal
2. Common issues:
   - Missing dependency
   - Syntax error
   - Import error

**Fix:**
```bash
# Clear Metro cache
pnpm start --clear

# Rebuild
pnpm android
```
