# BLE Mesh Network - Fixed Implementation

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. BLE Scanning Stability
**Problem:** "Cannot start scanning operation" error when scan called multiple times
**Solution:**
- Added proper scan cleanup before starting new scan
- Prevent `isScanning = false` on every error (was stopping scan prematurely)
- Only log permission errors without stopping scan callback
- Scan now stays active and handles errors gracefully

### 2. Bluetooth Payload Standards (BLE MTU Compliance)
**Problem:** Packets were sent as JSON without respecting BLE MTU limits (512 bytes)
**Solution:**
- Created `BLEPacketEncoder.ts` with proper binary serialization
- Packets are encoded to compact binary format
- Automatic chunking for packets > 512 bytes
- Proper chunk reassembly with headers
- Respects Bluetooth standards for reliable transmission

**Binary Format:**
```
[type:1byte][senderLen:2][sender][recipientLen:2][recipient?][timestamp:8][ttl:1][signatureLen:2][signature?][payloadLen:4][payload]
```

**Chunk Format (for large packets):**
```
[chunkIndex:4][totalChunks:4][data...]
```

### 3. Background Mesh Operations
**Problem:** Mesh needed to work when app is backgrounded
**Solution:**
- Already implemented via `BackgroundMeshManager.ts`
- App state monitoring detects background/foreground transitions
- Packets queued to background when app backgrounded
- BLE scanning resumes when returning to foreground
- Background relay ensures continuous mesh operation

### 4. Gossip Protocol Integration
**Problem:** Ensure all BLE messages properly propagate through gossip system
**Solution:**
- Flow verified: `sendPacket()` → `bleManager.broadcast()` → all connected peers
- Packets added to gossip manager for sync
- Messages queue when no peers connected (auto-sync when peers appear)
- Proper packet delegation through `GossipSyncManagerDelegate`

## 🔄 Complete Message Flow

### Sending a Message:
```

```

### Receiving a Message:
```

```

### Background Operation:
```
App Goes to Background
  ↓
onAppEnterBackground() triggered
  ↓
Packets added to background queue
  ↓
Background service continues BLE operations
  ↓
App Returns to Foreground
  ↓
onAppEnterForeground() triggered
  ↓
Resume BLE scanning
  ↓
Process queued packets

## 🎯 Bluetooth Standards Compliance

### MTU Limits
- ✅ Respects 512-byte BLE MTU
- ✅ Automatic chunking for large payloads
- ✅ Proper chunk headers with index/total

### Connection Handling
- ✅ Scan all devices (no UUID filter on Android)
- ✅ Proper connect/disconnect lifecycle
- ✅ Monitor characteristic changes for incoming data
- ✅ `allowDuplicates: true` for continuous discovery

### Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful Error 600 handling
- ✅ Scan continues through errors
- ✅ Retry logic preserved
- ✅ Proper permission checks

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### BLE Scanning
- [ ] App boots without "Cannot start scanning operation"
- [ ] Scan continues running (check logs for discoveries)
- [ ] Error 600 logged but doesn't crash
- [ ] Multiple scan start attempts don't conflict

### Packet Transmission
- [ ] Small messages (< 512 bytes) sent in 1 chunk
- [ ] Large messages split into multiple chunks
- [ ] Chunks arrive in order and reassemble correctly
- [ ] Binary encoding reduces payload size

### Gossip Propagation
- [ ] Message sent to Device A appears on Device B
- [ ] Message sent to Device B appears on Device A
- [ ] Device C (connected to A) receives messages from B
- [ ] No duplicate messages received
- [ ] TTL decrements properly

### Background Operation
- [ ] App backgrounds → packets still queue
- [ ] App foregrounds → BLE resumes scanning
- [ ] Background queue processes on resume
- [ ] Presence announced after foreground

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test on Two Physical Devices**
   - Install on both devices
   - Verify BLE peer discovery
   - Send messages both directions
   - Check logs for packet chunks

2. **Monitor BLE Stats**
   ```typescript
   const stats = meshNetworking.getBLEStats();
   console.log('Connected devices:', stats.connectedDevices);
   console.log('Is scanning:', stats.isScanning);
   ```

3. **Check Connected Peers**
   ```typescript
   const peers = meshNetworking.getConnectedBLEPeers();
   console.log('Peers:', peers);
   ```

4. **Verify Packet Encoding**
   - Watch logs for "Sending packet in X chunk(s)"
   - Should be 1 chunk for normal messages
   - Multiple chunks for large messages

## 🐛 Debug Commands

```typescript
// Check if BLE is working
meshNetworking.isBLEAvailable(); // Should be true

// Get connection stats
meshNetworking.getBLEStats();

// Get list of peers
meshNetworking.getConnectedBLEPeers();

// Check background status
await meshNetworking.getBackgroundMeshStatus();
```

## 📝 Log Messages to Watch For
