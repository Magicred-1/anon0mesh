# MANUAL LINKING APPLIED ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed react-native-peripheral build.gradle
Updated `/node_modules/react-native-peripheral/android/build.gradle`:
- Changed `apply plugin: 'maven'` → `apply plugin: 'maven-publish'` (maven plugin deprecated)
- Updated compileSdk from 28 → 36
- Updated minSdk from 16 → 24  
- Updated targetSdk from 28 → 36
- Added `namespace 'com.reactnative.peripheral'`
- Replaced jcenter() with mavenCentral()

### 2. Manually Linked in settings.gradle
Added to `/android/settings.gradle`:
```groovy
include ':react-native-peripheral'
project(':react-native-peripheral').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-peripheral/android')
```

### 3. Added Dependency in app/build.gradle
Added to `/android/app/build.gradle`:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation project(':react-native-peripheral')
    // ... other dependencies
}
```

## Next Steps

### Build and Test:
```bash
# Clean previous builds
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..

# Rebuild with manual linking
npx expo run:android
```

### Expected Result After Build:

**✅ SUCCESS - You should see:**
```
[PERIPHERAL] 🚀 Attempting to start GATT server...
[PERIPHERAL] ✅ Service added with UUID: 0000FFF0-...
[PERIPHERAL] ✅ GATT server advertising as: MESH-abc123
[PERIPHERAL] 📡 Others can now connect to us!
[BLE] ✅ GATT server started - we can now receive connections
```

**❌ IF STILL FAILING:**
```
[PERIPHERAL] ❌ Failed to start GATT server: Cannot read property 'addService' of null
```

This means the native module still isn't being loaded by React Native.

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check Native Module Registration

The module needs to be registered in the PackageList. Check:

```bash
# See what packages are registered
cat android/app/build/generated/rncli/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/PackageList.java
# Look for: new RNBlePeripheralPackage()
```

If not there, the autolinking isn't working. You'll need to manually add it to `MainApplication.kt`:

```kotlin
override fun getPackages(): List<ReactPackage> =
    PackageList(this).packages.apply {
        add(com.reactnative.peripheral.RNBlePeripheralPackage())
    }
```

### Alternative: Patch Package

If manual linking doesn't work, create a permanent patch:

```bash
npm install --save-dev patch-package
npx patch-package react-native-peripheral
```

This saves your build.gradle fixes so they survive `npm install`.

## Current Architecture Status

**With Manual Linking:**
- ✅ Native module should load
- ✅ GATT server should start
- ✅ Devices can accept incoming connections
- ✅ Bidirectional data exchange enabled
- ✅ **TRUE MESH NETWORKING!** 🎉

**Device A ↔ Device B:**
```
A (Central + Peripheral)  ←→  B (Central + Peripheral)
A connects TO B ✅            B connects TO A ✅
A writes to B ✅              B writes to A ✅
B notifies A ✅               A notifies B ✅
= FULL BIDIRECTIONAL MESH ✅
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails

**Error: "Plugin with id 'maven' not found"**
- ✅ Already fixed in build.gradle

**Error: "project ':react-native-peripheral' does not specify compileSdk"**
- ✅ Already fixed in build.gradle

**Error: "Package com.reactnative.peripheral does not exist"**
- Module isn't being compiled
- Check settings.gradle includes the module
- Run `./gradlew :react-native-peripheral:assemble` to test

### If Runtime Fails

**"Cannot read property 'addService' of null"**
- Native module not registered with React Native
- Check PackageList.java
- May need to manually add to MainApplication.kt

### Test Native Module Manually

```bash
cd android
./gradlew :react-native-peripheral:assemble
# If this fails, the module itself has build issues
```

## What Happens Next

After successful build:

1. **App starts** → Both devices create GATT servers ✅
2. **Devices scan** → Find each other via advertisements ✅
3. **Devices connect** → Bidirectional connections established ✅
4. **Data flows** → Messages exchange both ways ✅
5. **Mesh works!** → Real peer-to-peer networking ✅

The only thing that should change in logs:
```diff
- [PERIPHERAL] ❌ Failed to start GATT server: Cannot read property 'addService' of null
+ [PERIPHERAL] ✅ Service added with UUID: 0000FFF0-...
+ [PERIPHERAL] ✅ GATT server advertising as: MESH-abc123
+ [PERIPHERAL] 📡 Others can now connect to us!
```

And when sending messages:
```diff
- [BLE] ❌ Send failed to XX:XX:XX: Unknown error occurred
+ [BLE] ✅ Sent packet type 1 to XX:XX:XX
+ [PERIPHERAL] 📥 Received write request
+ [BLE] 📥 Received data via GATT server
```

## Ready to Build! 🚀

Run the build and let's see if manual linking fixes it:

```bash
cd /home/m4gicred1/Documents/coding/anon0mesh/offline-mesh-mvp
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
npx expo run:android
```

Watch for the GATT server startup logs! 🎯
